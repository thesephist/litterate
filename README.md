# litterate

Litterate is a command line tool to generate beautiful literate programming-style description of your code from comment annotations.

It's just being built, but feel free to check out what the output may look like when it's done, on [the documentation page for Torus](https://thesephist.github.io/torus/torus.js.html).

## Contributing

- `yarn install` to install dependencies (npm should work for these commands too, but the project prefers Yarn and we use a Yarn lockfile.)
- `yarn test` to run tests
